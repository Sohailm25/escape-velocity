# Limitations and Caveats — FTLE (FTLE / λ₁)

**For reviewers.** This one-page note accompanies the FTLE submission packet.

## 1. Escape Velocity Label Reliability

The collapse labels used as dependent variables in all six bridge tests were generated by an automated detector. Inter-rater reliability between two independent LLM raters was κ = 0.566 (Cohen's kappa), below the pre-registered threshold of 0.80. Raw agreement was 92.8% (167/180), but the low κ reflects high base-rate imbalance (most windows classified as "collapse" by both raters).

**Implication:** All reported effect sizes (ρ) may be attenuated or inflated by label noise in the dependent variable. The sensitivity analysis on the 167 rater-agreed subset shows consistent results (same 3 tests pass with comparable effect sizes), providing a partial robustness check but not a full resolution.

## 2. Predictive Association, Not Causation

FTLE λ₁ measures within-forward-pass depth dynamics (how hidden states evolve across transformer layers for a single input). Escape Velocity collapse metrics measure across-turn conversational dynamics (how model outputs degrade over a 40-turn dialogue). These operate on fundamentally different time axes.

The observed correlations (ρ = 0.51–0.54 for passing tests) indicate predictive association: models whose depth dynamics exhibit certain profile features (steeper slope, higher variance) tend to collapse more in extended conversations. No causal mechanism linking the two is established or claimed.

## 3. λ₁_mean Is Not Predictive

Three of six tests failed because `lambda1_mean` (average FTLE across layers) showed only weak association with collapse metrics (|ρ| = 0.04–0.25). This means the *level* of dynamical sensitivity is less informative than the *shape* of the depth profile (slope, variance). Any use of these results should note that mean FTLE alone is insufficient as a collapse predictor.

## 4. Model Family Confound

FTLE is computed per-model, and collapse behavior is also per-model. The four experimental conditions use three model families (Llama, Qwen, Mistral). HOMO_A and HETERO_ROT both use Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and produce identical λ₁ distributions (FTLE is computed on first-turn forward pass only). Between-model variation in λ₁ may partially reflect architectural differences rather than a generalizable depth-dynamics → collapse relationship.

## 5. Protocol Corrections

Two deviations from the pre-registered analysis plan were identified and corrected before results were finalized:
- Test #4 used an incorrect variable (`lambda1_std` instead of `layerwise_variance_mean`). Correction changed ρ from −0.059 to +0.511.
- `first_collapse_turn` missingness was handled by exclusion instead of censoring at turn 40. Correction changed n from 540 to 720 for affected tests.

Both corrections are documented with before/after comparisons in `results/phase3/DEVIATION_TABLE.md`. The fact that Test #4's pass status changed from FAIL to PASS on correction means this result should be interpreted with additional caution, even though the corrected analysis matches the pre-registered specification.

## 6. Precision Sensitivity

Float64 and float32 FTLE estimates are not interchangeable (Pearson r = 0.788 between precisions on GPT-2). All production runs used float32 consistently. Results should not be compared with FTLE values computed at different precisions.

## 7. Single First-Turn Measurement

FTLE is computed on the first assistant turn only, to avoid confounding with collapse dynamics that emerge over turns. This means λ₁ captures a static property of how the model processes the seed prompt — it does not track how depth dynamics evolve as collapse progresses. A longitudinal FTLE study (computing λ₁ at each turn) could provide stronger evidence but was out of scope.
