# FTLE — Final Results Packet

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Experiment:** Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (λ₁) estimation via JVP tangent propagation
**Status:** CLOSEOUT COMPLETE — awaiting publication-readiness review

## 1. Pre-Registration Criterion Outcome

**Criterion:** ≥1 of 6 pre-registered Spearman correlations achieves |ρ| ≥ 0.40 with Holm-adjusted p < 0.05.

**Result: MET** — 3/6 tests pass.

## 2. Primary Results (n=720)

### Passing Tests

| # | λ₁ Summary | Escape Velocity Metric | ρ | p_holm | 95% CI | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | lambda1_var (layerwise profile variance) | collapse_rate | **+0.511** | **2.41e-48** | [+0.45, +0.57] | ✅ |
| 5 | lambda1_slope (depth profile slope) | collapse_rate | **−0.536** | **5.24e-54** | [−0.59, −0.48] | ✅ |
| 6 | lambda1_slope (depth profile slope) | first_collapse_turn | **+0.507** | **1.22e-47** | [+0.45, +0.56] | ✅ |

### Failing Tests

| # | λ₁ Summary | Escape Velocity Metric | ρ | p_holm | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | lambda1_mean | collapse_rate | +0.246 | 4.26e-11 | ❌ (|ρ| < 0.40) |
| 2 | lambda1_mean | first_collapse_turn | −0.251 | 2.29e-11 | ❌ (|ρ| < 0.40) |
| 3 | lambda1_mean | collapse_incidence | +0.036 | 0.337 | ❌ |

## 3. Sensitivity Analysis (n=167 rater-agreed subset)

| # | λ₁ Summary | Escape Velocity Metric | ρ | p_holm | Pass |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | lambda1_mean | collapse_rate | +0.255 | 1.75e-03 | ❌ |
| 2 | lambda1_mean | first_collapse_turn | −0.265 | 1.64e-03 | ❌ |
| 3 | lambda1_mean | collapse_incidence | −0.005 | 0.947 | ❌ |
| 4 | lambda1_var | collapse_rate | **+0.545** | **1.39e-13** | ✅ |
| 5 | lambda1_slope | collapse_rate | **−0.557** | **3.15e-14** | ✅ |
| 6 | lambda1_slope | first_collapse_turn | **+0.516** | **3.86e-12** | ✅ |

Same 3 pass, same 3 fail. Effect sizes are consistent (within CIs) between primary and sensitivity.

## 4. Key Findings

**Strongest signals:** `lambda1_slope` (depth profile slope) and `lambda1_var` (layerwise profile variance) show medium-to-large predictive associations with Escape Velocity collapse metrics.

**Interpretation (predictive association only — no causal claims):**
- Steeper depth-profile slopes (more negative λ₁ trend across layers) are associated with higher collapse rates and earlier first-collapse turns.
- Higher layerwise λ₁ variance is associated with higher collapse rates.
- Mean λ₁ alone (`lambda1_mean`) shows weak-to-null association — the *shape* of the depth profile matters more than its average level.

**Claim language:** These are predictive associations between within-forward-pass depth dynamics (λ₁ profile features) and across-turn conversational dynamics (collapse metrics). No causal or mechanistic identity is claimed between the two time axes.

## 5. Escape Velocity Label-Reliability Caveat

⚠️ **Escape Velocity collapse labels were generated by an automated detector with unconfirmed inter-rater reliability** (Cohen's κ = 0.566, threshold 0.80 not met; raw agreement 92.8%, 167/180 agreed). All bridge correlations in this paper are subject to this limitation.

This means:
- The collapse labels used as the dependent variable in Tests #1–#6 have not passed the pre-registered reliability gate.
- Effect sizes may be attenuated or inflated by label noise.
- The sensitivity analysis on the 167 rater-agreed subset provides a partial robustness check but does not fully resolve this limitation.

## 6. Protocol Corrections

Two deviations from PREREG_v2.md were identified and corrected during Phase 3. Full details in `results/phase3/DEVIATION_TABLE.md`.

1. **Test #4 variable mapping:** Initially used `lambda1_std` (tangent-seed standard deviation). Corrected to `layerwise_variance_mean` (layerwise profile variance) per PREREG_v2 definition. Impact: ρ changed from −0.059 to +0.511.

2. **first_collapse_turn missingness:** Initially excluded non-collapsing runs (n=540). Corrected to censor at turn=40 per PREREG_v2 primary specification (n=720). Impact: Test #2 ρ weakened (still fails); Test #6 slightly attenuated (still passes).

## 7. Ops / Traceability

- **Postflight audit:** PASS (`ops_audit.py --mode postflight`)
- **Bootstrap:** n=10,000 resamples, bias-corrected percentile CIs, RNG seed=42
- **Multiple comparison correction:** Bonferroni-Holm step-down across 6 tests, family α=0.05
- **Pre-registration:** PREREG_v2.md committed before Phase 2 execution
- **Deviation audit trail:** `results/phase3/DEVIATION_TABLE.md`

### Key Parameters
- **Renorm cadence:** 4 (locked from Phase 1 selection — lowest median CV=0.028)
- **Tangent seeds:** 10 per trajectory (seeds 0–9), λ₁ = mean across seeds
- **Token position:** Mean over all assistant tokens (last-token exploratory only)
- **FTLE computed on:** First assistant turn only (avoids confounding with collapse dynamics)
- **RoPE fix:** `position_embeddings` kwarg passed through JVP for non-GPT2 models
